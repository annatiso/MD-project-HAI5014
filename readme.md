# Chatbots

A chatbot is a **digital agent** that can interact with a user through **natural text**. The chatbot takes as input a prompt from the user and outputs a response based on the prompt. The main uses of chatbots are customer service and virtual assistants.

## What are the features of a good chatbot?

When we talk about a *good* chatbot, it should present most of these characteristics:

1. **Memory**: It should remember information provided previously in the chat to respond in a consistent and coherent manner.
2. **Security**: It should handle user information in a responsible way to preserve the customers' privacy.
3. **Flexibility**: It should be able to adapt its style and responses based on the user's prompt and needs.
4. **Conversational ability**: It should output human-like responses that sound natural, smooth, and engaging.
5. **Accuracy**: The responses of the chatbot should be precise and correct, without hallucinations or false information.

These qualities are usually achieved through **artificial intelligence**, in particular large language models.

### Scripted chatbots

- Only allow the user to ask specific questions they can answer and cannot understand different issues or requests.
- Unnatural and robotic.
- Used in customer service because it allows the company to have more control over the chatbot's responses, but it does not add much value or information.

### Offensive chatbots - Tay by Microsoft

- Twitter chatbot designed to learn how to interact with humans on the platform but quickly started to output racist and offensive text.
- When the training data is not appropriately filtered, the chatbot will have biases and will likely produce harmful responses.
