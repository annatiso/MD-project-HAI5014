# Chatbots
A chatbot is a **digital agent** that can interact with an user through **natural text**. The chatbot takes as input a prompt from the user and outputs a response based on the prompt. The main uses of chatbots are customer service and virtual assistants.

## What are the features of a good chatbot?
When we talk about a *good* chatbot, it should present most of these characteristics:
- **memory**: it should remember information provided previously in the chat to respond in a consistent and coherent manner
- **security**: it should handle user information in a responsible way to preserve the customers' privacy
- **flexibility**: it should be able to adapt its style and responses based on the user's prompt and needs
- **conversational**: it should output human-like responses that sound natural, smooth and engaging
- **accuracy**: the responses of the chatbot should be precise and correct, without hallucinations or false information

These qualities are usually achieved through **artificial intelligence**, in particular large language models.
