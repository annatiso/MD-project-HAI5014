## Introduction

A chatbot is a **digital agent** that can interact with a user through **natural text**. The chatbot takes as input a prompt from the user and outputs a response based on the prompt. The main uses of chatbots are customer service and virtual assistants.

## What are the features of a good chatbot?

When we talk about a *good* chatbot, it should present most of these characteristics:

1. **Memory**: It should remember information provided previously in the chat to respond in a consistent and coherent manner.
2. **Security**: It should handle user information in a responsible way to preserve the customers' privacy.
3. **Flexibility**: It should be able to adapt its style and responses based on the user's prompt and needs.
4. **Conversational ability**: It should output human-like responses that sound natural, smooth, and engaging.
5. **Accuracy**: The responses of the chatbot should be precise and correct, without hallucinations or false information.

These qualities are usually achieved through **artificial intelligence**, in particular large language models.
