## Introduction

A chatbot is a **digital agent** that can interact with a user through **natural text**. The chatbot takes as input a prompt from the user and outputs a response based on the prompt. The main uses of chatbots are customer service and virtual assistants.

## What are the features of a good chatbot?

According to the [resources](#references) I read, a *good* chatbot should exhibit most of these characteristics:

1. üß† **Memory**: It should remember information provided previously in the chat to respond in a consistent and coherent manner.
2. üîê **Security**: It should handle user information responsibly to preserve the customer's privacy.
3. üí´ **Flexibility**: It should be able to adapt its style and responses based on the user's prompt and needs.
4. üí¨ **Conversational ability**: It should output human-like responses that sound natural, smooth, and engaging.
5. ‚úÖ **Accuracy**: The responses of the chatbot should be precise and correct, without hallucinations or false information.

These qualities are usually achieved through **artificial intelligence**, in particular large language models.

## Examples of good chatbots

### Natural-sounding example - [Chat GPT](https://chatgpt.com/)

![Screenshot of Chat GPT](images/ChatGPT.png)

- Understands the context and nuances of user input.
- Allows the user to personalize the chat by specifying the preferred tone and providing any information that Chat GPT should remember.
- Fluent in multiple languages and sounds natural.

### Secure example - [Claude](https://claude.ai/new)

![Screenshot of Claude](images/Claude.png)

- Focuses on user security and privacy.
- Monitors its own behavior to avoid harmful and dangerous responses.
- Provides human-like responses and understands complex user prompts.

### Real-time information search example - [Perplexity](https://www.perplexity.ai/)

![Perplexity screenshot](images/Perplexity.png)

- Enhanced deep research feature with access to real-time information.
- High accuracy in the responses, and it cites the sources so the user can double-check.

### Regulation-compliant example - [PizzaGPT](https://www.pizzagpt.it/)

![Screenshot of PizzaGPT](images/PizzaGPT.png)

- When ChatGPT was banned in Italy due to privacy concerns, this chatbot was created. It avoids storing user data and thus complies with Italian law.
- Based on GPT 3.5, it allows a smooth and natural conversation flow in different languages, including Italian.
- Created a sense of identity for Italian users, which allowed it to remain popular for a while even after ChatGPT was reintroduced in Italy.

## What makes a chatbot bad?

A chatbot is *bad* because it exhibits one or more of the following characteristics:

1. ‚ùå **Unreliability**: It is not transparent about its capabilities and provides wrong or inaccurate information, misleading the users.
2. ü§ñ **Rigid and unnatural conversation**: It lacks adaptability to the user's style and tone, sounds robotic and unnatural, and makes the conversation awkward and uncomfortable instead of smooth and engaging.
3. üò£ **Frustrating**: It does not understand user input well and provides answers that are irrelevant or unrelated to the user's requests, sometimes sounding nonsensical.
4. üìâ **No added value**: Provides shallow or obvious information, which is not helpful to the user.
5. ü§¨ **Offensive behavior**: It produces offensive or harmful responses, resulting in AI misuse and potentially dangerous content.
6. ‚ùì **Short memory**: Does not remember previous questions and answers, leading to repetitions and contradictions in the conversation.
7. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Privacy issues**: It does not handle sensitive data properly, breaching user trust and regulations.

## Examples of bad chatbots

### Offensive example - [Tay by Microsoft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tay_(chatbot))

![Screenshot of Tay Twitter profile](https://s.abcnews.com/images/Technology/HT_twitter_TayandYou_ml_160325_16x9_1600.jpg)

- Twitter chatbot designed to learn how to interact with humans on the platform but quickly started to output racist and offensive text.
- When the training data is not appropriately filtered, the chatbot will have biases and will likely produce harmful responses.

### Frustrating example - [Poncho](https://github.com/jrnnynrlson/poncho)

![Screenshots of Poncho chatbot's mistakes](https://d2ymzkn1ailq93.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/poncho-chatbot-snapmunk-gizmodo.jpg)

- Only allows the user to ask specific questions and often does not understand the user's request properly, sounding unnatural and robotic.
- Responds with inaccurate or wrong information.
- Does not bring much value or new information to the user and causes frustration due to the difficult interaction.

### Non-conversational example - [TK Assistant](https://www.turkishairlines.com/en-it/any-questions/get-in-touch/)

<img src="images/TKAssistant.png" alt="Screenshot of Turkish Airlines assistant's example chat" width="350">

- Structured as a menu-based chatbot, it does not allow the user to type input and it barely feels like a conversation.
- Does not add much value as the user still needs to navigate the options autonomously, and the chatbot is not providing additional help compared to a normal webpage.
- Can feel limiting and frustrating for the user.
